# File: blueprints/automation/generic_ikea_tradfri_remote_blinds_control.yaml
# This blueprint allows you to control one or more covers (blinds) using an IKEA Tradfri open/close remote over ZHA.
# It supports three commands:
#   • "up_open": Open the covers (set to a defined open position)
#   • "down_close": Close the covers (set to a defined close position)
#   • "stop", "stop_opening", "stop_closing": Stop the covers (set to a defined stop position)
#
# The blueprint uses default device IDs and positions from your custom automations.
# You can change these defaults when you create an automation from this blueprint.

blueprint:
  name: Generic IKEA Tradfri Remote Blinds Control
  description: >
    This blueprint enables control of covers (blinds) with an IKEA Tradfri open/close remote using ZHA.
    It listens for remote button events and sets the covers to the desired positions:
      - "up_open" sets the covers to the open position.
      - "down_close" sets the covers to the closed position.
      - "stop", "stop_opening", or "stop_closing" sets the covers to the stop position.
